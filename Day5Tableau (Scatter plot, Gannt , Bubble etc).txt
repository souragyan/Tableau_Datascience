

Reference lines
1) simply go to axis and click on add reference line, this will help us draw a line
Reference lines, bands, distribution can be used based on the business logic, they are usely used for benchmarking

Forecasting-Predicting futre trends, estimating future trends given the past (Historic) Data
Time series
use historic data -2015, 2016, 2017, 2018
connect to sample store for this exercise
Ex: Business was established 4 years ago , what will be my profit in 2019 of superstore , given historic data
You can predict sales, profit, 
1) create time series chart or line chart (x axis shoudld be time)
by default it is exponential smoothing- more importance is given to 2018 and least weightage is given to 2015
EX : profit(2019)= 0.8*profit(2018)+ 0.6*profit(2017)+...(tableau will take care of the weights)
You can ignore the last month or inlcude it based on business logic
confidence interval (we cannot be 100% perfect) so we go for 95% confidence level( there is 95% chance)

Scatter plot - Correlation analysis
1)It will comment on the direction of relationship
2)strength of the relationship
Linear trend line- equation of straight line(y=mx+c), y here is profit(it should always be on y axis)
x here is sales (it should always be on x axis )y= f(x), profit= f(sales), Rsquare 0.22, it is not a great model, i converted my model from linear to power , R square improved to 0.78
c is y intercept
p value <0.05 is allowed, confidence level is 95%

what will be output when given input is provided
Ex: what will be theweight gained given calories consumed
Ex: what will be the profit given sales is 100k
wind speed vs power output

Gantt chart -list of events against a timeline
connect to build a house dataset
1) bring category on my row shelf
2) bring my start date on column shelf
3)then right click on date and arrange it as per exact value
4) i have to put my duration on my size shelf
5) then i can color my chart based on category
6) i have to goto my category and arrange the order based on field (start date ) and select minimum value
Tableau will give us a gannt chart 

Histogram
use coffee chain data
Objective: to perform distributive analysis
1 measure is enough( sales is enough or profit is enough)
Drag sales onto row shelf.Tableau will create by default sales bin with specificsize( 34.3)
if we want to manually change the bin size then , go to sales measure and click on create bin(with size 60)
drag this newly created bin onto my canvas ,Then if we want to convert the resultant figure into histogram , increase bar size or change sales bin to discrete data type
bins can be created only on measures

Box and whisker plot- distribution analysis on data
use sample superstore
divide data into 4 quartiles
Business Problem: discount being offered across different regions and segments
5 point chart(min value , max value, median, q1 and q3)
q1 is known as lower hinge(lower quartile)
q3 is known as upper hinge(upper quartile)
from minimum to upper hinge 75 percentile of data is concentrated
from minimum to lower hinge 25 percentile of data is concentrated
box will contain 50% of data distribution- it is nothing but peak in the data( middle 50% of data )
any outliers will be outside of box and whiskers
lenght of whiskers -data within 1.5times the interquartile range
interquartile range(iqr) =q3-q1
length of upper whisker= q3+1.5*iqr (>=this value will be an outlier)
length of lower lower whisker= q1-1.5*iqr


Bullet graph- strictly 2 measures (select profit vs budgeted profit)
1)connect to your coffee chain database
2)Drag profit and budget profit onto canvas and select bullett graph
3)Blue bar is my budget profit (258,760), actual profit will be my reference line (259,543)
4) Overall result is - Actual profit > budget profit(this is good result), If i dig deeper and do a market analysis , i can say that my southern region the worst performing region and my east region was very good.
5)60% of target , 80% of target can also be seen in my bullett graph for reference


Bubble chart- control size and color
negative profit cannot be represented with negative area
there use profit on color shelf, and sales on size as sales cannot be negative
number of bubbles will be determined by sub categorie elements
1) Drag profit onto row shelf
2) Drag subcategory onto column shelf
3) Goto show me panle and select packed bubbles
4)Drag your profit onto your color shelf 
5)Drag your sales onto your size shelf
